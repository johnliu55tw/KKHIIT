# HIIT Timer powered by KKBOX

## Introduction

High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is a form of interval training,
a cardiovascular exercise strategy alternating short periods of intense anaerobic exercise with less intense recovery periods.
It requires one performs a short burst of high-intensity (or max-intensity) exercise followed by a brief low-intensity activity,
repeatedly. Most of the time the high and low interval are regulated by time.
For example, the period of high and low intensity can be set to 20 and 40 seconds respectively,
and 20 sets of them form a HIIT routine, which takes 20 minutes. Therefore, for the time regulated HIIT, a timer is required.

There are a bunch of options while choosing a HIIT timer on different platforms (iOS, Android, and web-based).
However, not many of them have integrated music playing service.
If you ever worked out, you know that music could help you immerse into the mood for the coming up training set,
which makes you feel pumped and perform better. In the case of HIIT, as I mentioned before,
requires one to give their 100% effort in the high intensity period,
which means one must be emotionally ready for the coming up torture.
Thus, for the training project, I wish to design a HIIT timer with KKBOX music service integrated.
